This chapter describes the: 

=== Business Context

Validator node operators run sgxwallet to support signing of messages among their nodes.

A node operator initializes sgxwallet and retains a secret backup key when initializing the server.

The server URL is then used by each SKALE node to establish a secure connection with the sgxwallet server to send and receive messages to interact with the secure enclave.

| Description

| validator
| runs SKALE Nodes. Wants nodes to sign blocks and messages using BLS threshold cryptography, and messages using ECDSA.

| DKG private key shares
| `sgxwallet` reads key shares and computes polynomials, interacting with SKALE Nodes.

| BLS private key database
| `sgxwallet` stores and rotates private key shares for each associated SKALE Chain.

| TLS Connection
| `sgxwallet` establishes a secure connection with each connected SKALE Node.

| SKALE Nodes
| Interact with SKALE Manager contacts on Ethereum to perform DKG in response to SKALE Chain creation and node rotation requests. Nodes also sign messages such as blocks and transactions using `sgxwallet` secure enclave BLS keys.
