If you want to build the server first, start with [building.md](building.md).

Otherwise, with docker installed, pull one of the two containers:

```bash
docker pull skalenetwork/sgxwalletsim

```

or 

```bash
docker pull skalenetwork/sgxwallet_base

```

To configure the containers with docker-compose, see [configuring.md](configuring.md).
